# Connecting Boston: Local Activity Group Web App

## 📘 Overview

This project delivers a lightweight, real-world web application that helps Boston residents find and participate in local activity groups. It solves the problem of scattered or inaccessible group listings by offering a centralized, intuitive platform where users can join activities, register for events, and leave feedback.

Organizers benefit from tools that help them manage sessions, track membership, and gather insights from reviews. The backend is built in Flask with a normalized SQLite database and a user-friendly HTML/CSS/Jinja2 frontend.

Key capabilities:
- Discover and filter groups by interest, cost, frequency, and age group
- Register for events and track participation
- Leave reviews (feature in progress)
- Enable organizers to manage groups, schedule events, and oversee engagement

## 📊 Recent Feature Additions

Following the latest commits, the application has been extended to support several major features:

- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: A dedicated view for admins to manage events and oversee user activity.
- 👤 **User Profiles**: Each user now has an associated profile for personalization and data management.
- 🔄 **Prerequisite Tracking**: Events can now specify required prerequisite events.
- 🕒 **Waitlist Functionality**: Users can be placed on a waitlist when events are full.
- 📥 **Registration System**: Users can now register for events directly via the site interface.
- 👀 **User and Admin Views**: The interface dynamically changes based on user role, separating admin and participant capabilities.
- 🔔 **User Notifications**: The app now supports sending notifications related to registration and waitlist status.

These features significantly enhance user experience, data flow, and platform scalability.

## 🗂️ E-R Diagram and Schema Summary

### Entities and Attributes
- **Users**: `id (PK)`, `username`, `email`, `hashed_password`
- **Groups**: `id (PK)`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `cost`
- **Events**: `id (PK)`, `group_id (FK)`, `title`, `date`, `location`
- **Registrations**: `id (PK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `event_id (FK)`, `status`
- **Reviews** (in dev): `id (PK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `group_id (FK)`, `star_rating`, `comment`

### Design Notes:
- One user can join multiple groups
- Events can have sessions and prerequisites
- Form-based UI enables DB interaction
- Authenticated users can only modify their own data
